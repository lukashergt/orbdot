# Welcome to OrbDot!

**In development**

This Python package is designed for studying the secular (long-term) evolution of exoplanet orbits in an observational context. It facilitates model fitting of (any combination of) transit and eclipse timing data, radial velocities, and transit durations with nested sampling algorithms, enabling users to harness the power of nested sampling with fewer headaches.

In addition to model fitting, OrbDot features a built-in `Analysis` class that automates the numerical interpretation of results, generating reports on model comparison, tidal decay parameters, predicted precession rates, implications for planetary companions, and more.
